This repo contains some
[karabiner](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) key-bindings for
personal use.

All the keybindings are meant for **DV** keyboard only. So the actual keys
appeared in the configuration may look different from the description. But to apply
changes in a QWERTY keyboard, just change the keys in configuration back to the
ones mentioned in description.
